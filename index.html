          <h2>Maximizing prisoner potential through work</h2>
          <p>
            Prisoners spend a lot of time working and developing valuable
            skills.
            <b>Prisoner Skills</b> allows you to access information about
            prisoner job skills and put them to good use, whether you are a
            potential employer looking to hire someone after release, or just a
            prison adminstrator looking for a way to coordinate prison work
            activities.

          <h3>Employers</h3>
          <p>
            As an employer, you want to know the history and skill set of the
            people you are hiring. Prisoner Skills gives you access to valuable
            information regarding prisoner work history and skill sets. Instead
            of having to track down past employers to verify work history, you
            will be able to browse the past jobs of inmates with confidence. All
            prisoner profiles are directly maintained by prison administrators,
            so you know that the information is true.

          <h3>Administrators</h3>
          <p>
            As a prison adminstrator, you have many work activities to
            coordinate. We understand how difficult and complex that can be.
            Prisoner Skills gives you a better way to manage your day-to-day
            operations. By tracking and organizing the skill sets developed by
            your inmates, you will be able to place them in jobs where they will
            be more effective, allowing operations to run more smooothly and
            efficiently.
